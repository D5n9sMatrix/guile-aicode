# Rounding of Numbers

# Description
# ceiling takes a single numeric argument x and returns a numeric vector containing 
# the smallest integers not less than the corresponding elements of x.

# floor takes a single numeric argument x and returns a numeric vector containing the 
# largest integers not greater than the corresponding elements of x.

# trunc takes a single numeric argument x and returns a numeric vector containing the 
# integers formed by truncating the values in x toward 0.

# round rounds the values in its first argument to the specified number of decimal 
# places (default 0). See ‘Details’ about “round to even” when rounding off a 5.

# signif rounds the values in its first argument to the specified number of significant 
# digits. Hence, for numeric x, signif(x, dig) is the same as round(x, dig - ceiling(log10(abs(x)))). 
# For complex x, this is not the case, see the ‘Details’.

# Usage

# ceiling(x)
# floor(x)
# trunc(x, ...)

# round(x, digits = 0)
# signif(x, digits = 6)
# Arguments
# x	
# a numeric vector. Or, for round and signif, a complex vector.

# digits	
# integer indicating the number of decimal places (round) 
# or significant digits (signif) to be used. Negative values 
# are allowed (see ‘Details’).

# ...	
# arguments to be passed to methods.

# Details
# These are generic functions: methods can be defined for them 
# individually or via the Math group generic.

# Note that for rounding off a 5, the IEC 60559 standard (see also 
# ‘IEEE 754’) is expected to be used, ‘go to the even digit’. Therefore 
# round(0.5) is 0 and round(-1.5) is -2. However, this is dependent on 
# OS services and on representation error (since e.g. 0.15 is not 
# represented exactly, the rounding rule applies to the represented 
# number and not to the printed number, and so round(0.15, 1) could 
# be either 0.1 or 0.2).

# Rounding to a negative number of digits means rounding to a power 
# of ten, so for example round(x, digits = -2) rounds to the nearest 
# hundred.

# For signif the recognized values of digits are 1...22, and non-missing 
# values are rounded to the nearest integer in that range. Complex numbers 
# are rounded to retain the specified number of digits in the larger of the 
# components. Each element of the vector is rounded individually, unlike 
# printing.

# These are all primitive functions.

# S4 methods
# These are all (internally) S4 generic.

# ceiling, floor and trunc are members of the Math group generic. As an 
# S4 generic, trunc has only one argument.

# round and signif are members of the Math2 group generic.

# Warning
# The realities of computer arithmetic can cause unexpected results, 
# especially with floor and ceiling. For example, we ‘know’ that 
# floor(log(x, base = 8)) for x = 8 is 1, but 0 has been seen on an 
# R platform. It is normally necessary to use a tolerance.

# Rounding to decimal digits in binary arithmetic is non-trivial 
# (when digits != 0) and may be surprising. Be aware that most decimal 
# fractions are not exactly representable in binary double precision. 
# In R 4.0.0, the algorithm for round(x, d), for d > 0, has been 
# improved to measure and round “to nearest even”, contrary to earlier 
# versions of R (or also to sprintf() or format() based rounding).
